# Persona Simulation
This folder contains codes that generate prompts instructing LLMs to simulate different personalities/personas to respond to psychological tests such as BFI-2, IPIP-300, and HEXACO tests.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Run the preprocess script preprocess.py to generate the instructions, and then run main script main.py to simulate the corresponding personalities to give responses. The results will be stored in ./output directory.

### Arguments
You can customize the behavior of the preprocess.py script by modifying the command-line arguments:
```
--description: The type of personality generation method. Choose 'persona_description', 'personal_profile', 'interview', 'transcript'.
--questionnaire: The type of psychological personality test used in the experiment. Choose 'hexaco', 'bfi60', 'ipip300', 'force_choice'.
--persona_save_path: Path to the output CSV file containing randomly selected persona.
--profile_save_path: Path to the output CSV file containing the personal profile generated by the shape metod.
```

You can customize the behavior of the main.py script by modifying the command-line arguments:
```
--instruction: Path to the input CSV file containing the prompt instructions generated by preprocess.py.
--save: Path to the output CSV file where the results will be saved.
--questionnaire: The type of psychological personality test used in the experiment. Choose 'hexaco', 'bfi60', 'ipip300', 'force_choice'.
--task: The mode in which to run the script. Choose 'force_choice', 'score_scale' or 'real_world_simulation'.
--voter: The number of geneartions for each data point. If n > 1, the final code is an aggreation of mutiple generations by majority vote. Default is 1.
--api_key: Your API key. If not provided, the script will attempt to use the environment variable.
--model_type: The type of LLMs to use. Choose 'gpt', 'claude' or 'llama'.
--model_name: The name of the GPT or Claude model to use. Default is 'gpt-3.5-turbo'.
--batch_size: The batch size for saving the coding progress. Default is 100 (reuslts will be saved for everyon 100 data points).
```
